                As a young child, I frequented Tunisia with my family. 
                Tunisia is a North African country bordering the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara Desert. It truly is an incredible country.
                It is quite unique in the sense that it is quite western, even though it is an Arab Republic. That is not common among
                similar countries. What struck me most about Tunisia is the warmth of the people there. I haven't quite met people like them
                even after travelling to a number of other countries since.<br/><br/> According to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Tunisia"><i>Britannica</i></a>, 
                <q>This warmth, joined with the country’s renowned hospitality and cuisine, has contributed greatly to Tunisia’s growing popularity 
                as a destination for tourists from throughout Europe and the Americas.</q>

                The United States of America is a favourite of mine. I have visited New York City and Orlando, Florida. A friend of ours lives in Brooklyn,
                so we have been to stay with them. Brooklyn is a really incredible place. With an interesting mix of both urban and classic architecture and culture,
                Brooklyn is once again an up and coming area in the city. While the drama of it's crime-filled past still taints the suburb, a liberal youth
                are attempting to rebuild the area's reputation as one of art and acceptance.

                Europe is an incredibly diverse continent. I've had the chance to travel to the UK, France, Spain and Germany. My brother resides in Southern Germany,
                on the Swiss border, in a city called Konstanz. <br/><br/>
                According to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Tourism-g198393-Konstanz_Baden_Wurttemberg-Vacations.html?fid=4cc3279d-f91c-47be-9e4b-30319ecbf01b">Tripadvisor</a>,
                <q>Lying on picturesque Lake Constance (or Bodensee in German), Konstanz has been a city since the first century AD, 
                    later gaining prominence as a religious center and then as the site of the only bridge crossing the Rhine River. 
                    The Old Town is one of Konstanz’s main attractions and is home to the city’s famed cathedral, 
                    originally dating from the 7th century. Due to a border anomaly, Konstanz lies on Switzerland’s land mass, 
                    and the Swiss town of Kreuzlingen is just a short walk away.</q><br/><br/>
                As a European destination, Konstanz cannot be missed. I like to call it, 'the German Tenerife', because of it's incredible weather and picturesque
                waterways. It's absolutely a favourite of mine.

            <h3>Sport is undoubtedly my main interest in life, and takes up most of my time outside of college.</h3>

                The only sport I actually play is hurling. Hurling has been a major interest of mine since I was very young. Trips to Croke Park to watch
                Cork play were a common event during my childhood, a leading inspiration in my interest in the sport. I've had quite a few proud achievements
                on the hurling field, thankfully. At the age of 15, I won the under-16 hurling county with my local club. We beat some tough opposition
                to win the trophy, and it is a moment I will never forget. <br/><br/>
                Similarly, at the age of 18, I won the Cork City U21 hurling championship. While I didn't get much game-time as part of the team, I was
                still apart of the squad, and played my part in helping the team prepare for the win. It was another great moment.

                Other than the GAA, my predominant sporting interest is soccer. I am a shareholder in Cork City Football Club, my local League of Ireland
                Premier Division team. The League of Ireland is a major, major passion of mine. I am a strong believer in the term, 'The Greatest League
                In The World', which is often associated with the league. <br/><br/>
                I feel like the league isn't treated very well in Ireland, signified by the generally low attendances at games. The majority of people
                in Ireland prefer to support teams like Liverpool or Manchester United. While I think it is fine to support these teams, I think there
                is <i>nothing</i> better than supporting your local team. I think being there to see Cork City win the league in 2017 was one of the greatest
                moments, not just of my sporting life, but my life as a whole. Moments like that cannot be beaten.

                Besides soccer and GAA, American Football is definitely my favourite sport. I am a masssive fan of the Tennessee Titans of the National
                Football League (NFL), a team based in Nashville, Tennessee. I was lucky enough to see the team play in London against the Los Angeles
                Chargers in 2018, and meet the (billionaire) owner of the team in a pub in London City beforehand. It was an incredible experience.
                There's an insane sense of togetherness among American Football fans in Ireland, given the niche nature of the sport. This is another
                reason why I'm such a big believer in it. <br/><br/>
                It really is underappreciated, and a truly unbelievable sport.
