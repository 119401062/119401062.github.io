                <p>Gartner Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2020 have listed Hyper Automation as one of the biggest trends for 2020,
                as more and more enterprises are adopting automation in their work processes. Forrester has predicted that the global market for RPA services will
                hit US$7.7 billion next year and is expected to grow to US$12 billion in 2023. AI is increasing productivity through automation and is helping organizations
                derive meaning from ever-larger data sets. Hyper-automation is the mixture of automation technologies that exist to expand and increase human capabilities
                by allowing organisations to automate more complex work with the help of robotic process automation (RPA) at its core, with artificial intelligence (AI),
                process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools that strengthen the ability to automate work. As defined by Gartner: “Hyper-automation deals with
                the application of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and
                augment humans.” The adoption of Automation is helping organizations, that are data-driven, to be able to better respond to their customers’ demands,
                identify new business opportunities, improve their service delivery, eliminate all human errors, and reduce costs.
                The idea is to automate more and more knowledge work, and engage everyone in an organization to be part of the transformation.<br/><br/>
