            <p>AI is increasing productivity through automation and is helping organizations
            derive meaning from ever-larger data sets. Hyper-automation is the mixture of automation technologies that exist to expand and increase human capabilities
            by allowing organisations to automate more complex work with the help of robotic process automation (RPA) at its core, with artificial intelligence (AI),
            process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools that strengthen the ability to automate work. As defined by Gartner (Gartner Top 10 Strategic Technology
            Trends for 2020): "Hyper-automation deals with the application of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML),
            to increasingly automate processes and augment humans.” The adoption of Automation is helping organizations, that are data-driven, to be able to better
            respond to their customers’ demands, identify new business opportunities, improve their service delivery, eliminate all human errors, and reduce costs.
            The idea is to automate more and more knowledge work, and engage everyone in an organization to be part of the transformation.<br/><br/>

            <p>Multi-experience development platforms (MXDPs) help enterprises to rapidly scale their applications across a range of devices and platforms.
            MXDPs can help you develop a single application that can be deployed on a variety of devices. This greatly shortens down your efforts and gives brands
            more control over their digital experiences. Buyers in the market are looking to address the challenge of building and delivering a sizable portfolio of
            mobile apps for customers, partners, and employees. They now are looking for complete user experience. It is no longer enough for them to simply interact
            with a mobile app or web application. MADPs have enabled development for mobile, web, and desktop web. Even hitting the minimum, brands are now including
            one more additional experience, which includes – chats, AR, and wearable. Consumers’ desire for more have caused the evolution MXDPs that supports Multiple
            Experience<br/><br/>

            <p>The cloud expands its territory and becomes a distributed cloud. This is the distribution of public cloud services to different locations while
            the originating public cloud provider assumes responsibility for the operation, governance, updates to and evolution of the services.
            According to industry analyst Gartner's report, this represents a significant shift from the centralized model of most public cloud services and will
            lead to a new era in cloud computing. A distributed cloud means that the computation, storage, and networking are in a micro-cloud located outside the
            centralized cloud. The distributed cloud is closer to the end-user as a decentralized cloud system.<br/><br/>
